# NSGA-II_Python_for_SWAT-modified
A personal modification of https://github.com/mehmetbercan/NSGA-II_Python_for_SWAT_model

This modification allows you to optimize a monthly SWAT model by extracting simulated values from YIELD and NSURQ variables of several HRU's and using a customized optimization function.
It is not necessary to install NSGA as library anymore, all the input/required paths were modified to only put the scipts into one folder and change the path of the Glue SWAT-CUP project.
